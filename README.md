## Fitness-club-System

the objectif of this project is to practic some notions that i learned, file
handling for exemple has been used for almost all functions.Binary
Files has been used to store data related to members accounts.
The source code of this project could be short and more optimised if i
worked on one .c file but i preferd to work on multiple c files so i can
get familiar with extern variables.

This project “Fitness club System” is based on Members account
Management in a fitness club, so with this program you can create a
new member account, update some information of an existing
member, view and manage member's records, check the details of an
existing member, remove existing member and view all members’ list.
